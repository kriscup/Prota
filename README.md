# Prota Application
### Class: CSCI401 - Software Engineering

## Description
   This is a task manager app that can create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as organize tasks in custom catagories, and view tasks separated by date on a calendar. Along with the initial features, it also includes the ability to change resolutions, change between dark and light mode, send email notifications in order to save your information, and set an active task in your tray. This was implemented using Windows Presentation Format (WPF) in Visual Basic and C# for the front end and back end (respectively). As a result, this is only avaliable on the Windows OS.
   
## Task
   The goal of this class was to work with a small team in an agile environment through Azure DevOps, working in 2 week sprints to create a minimum viable product to present at the end of the semester, as well as presenting milestone updates at the end of every sprint, ending the semester with 7 total sprints. Our team decided on the tasklist application as our mvp because of its ability to implement additional features as needed after the mvp was completed.
